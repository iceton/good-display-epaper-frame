Rough upload of files related to displaying images and accepting/processing uploads. My use is on an internal network so there's no auth/security. Beware some vibe coding.

- Arduino project to display images
- HTML to crop and upload image
- Ruby FCGI to process image
- STL files for frame/case 3d print
- Service/socket files for Ubuntu
- nginx site conf
